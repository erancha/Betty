### Database

#### Tables Schema

##### a) Users

- `category` (matchup category)
- `status` (Open/Closed)

##### c) Stakes

- `matchupId` (Foreign Key)
- `userId` (Foreign Key)
- `amount` (Stake amount)
- `status` (Won/Lost)
- `createdAt`

#### Relationships

- Stakes have a 1:n relationship with Users.
- Each bet has multiple stakes, but each stake belongs to only one user.

#### Additional Requirements

- Store results and winning amounts.
- Real-time updates for admin changes.

## Solution

### 1. Overview

Betty is an MVP level serverless betting application built with AWS, React, and WebSockets.  
The application is available online: [Deployment](#4-deployment)

### 2. Architecture

![Architecture diagram](https://lucid.app/publicSegments/view/48c09f9c-c982-4dfd-9837-d6b5b3817ba1/image.jpeg)

#### 2.1 Backend

- **AWS Lambda** functions (Node.js) for serverless compute
- **AWS API Gateway** with **WebSocket** APIs
- **AWS Cognito** for API authentication
- **AWS Elasticache Redis** to manage active user connection IDs and cache matchups
- **AWS DynamoDB** for storage
- **AWS SQS** for decoupling and network isolation between Lambda functions

#### 2.2 Frontend

- Single Page Application (SPA) built with **React**
- Hosted on **AWS S3**
- Accessed through **AWS CloudFront** for global delivery
- **Stack**: React, Redux, TypeScript.

##### State Management

- Uses Redux and Redux Thunk
- Components connect to Redux using `connect` HOC (Higher-Order Component)

### 3. Security Considerations

- Data in transit is encrypted with **HTTPS**
- User authentication via AWS Cognito with **Google** integration
- Lambda functions and Elasticache Redis are in a **private subnet**
- IAM roles follow the least privilege principle

### 4. Deployment

- Uses AWS SAM (Serverless Application Model) for deployment
- Infrastructure is defined with CloudFormation templates
- Deploy with a single command: `sam build` and `sam deploy`
- The application is available online at https://dkw6xqmc37czd.cloudfront.net/

### 5. Scalability, Performance and Resiliency

- Serverless architecture enables automatic scaling
- Elasticache Redis enhances the scalability of read operations
- CloudFront provides low-latency content delivery

#### Eventual consistency

In this architecture, the user balance is updated in the Users table through a DynamoDB stream processor (a Lambda function) that processes updates from the Matchups table. The balance is only updated after the matchup update has been persisted. This approach can introduce a delay in balance updates, meaning users may not see their updated balance instantly. However, this delay is often acceptable in scenarios where immediate consistency is not critical, enabling more resilient systems.

Additionally, this design can improve scalability because the streams processor can handle a large volume of events asynchronously. This allows the primary application (the Generic Websocket Receiver â€”refer to the [Architecture diagram](#2-architecture)) to remain responsive and effectively manage incoming requests without being blocked by the balance update operations. Overall, this architecture separates concerns and facilitates more efficient resource utilization.

### 6. Monitoring & Logging

- Monitoring and logging via AWS CloudWatch

### 7. Cost Optimization

- Pay-per-use model for serverless components
- Elasticache and VPC resources have hourly costs

### Appendix: Considerations for Choosing Between SQL and NoSQL for Betting Application

#### Context

In the development of this betting application, a crucial decision lies between using a SQL database or a NoSQL database like DynamoDB.  
The requirements are to quickly develop a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) with the potential for rapid user growth and limited need for complex queries.

#### Data Structure Discussion

##### Initial Proposal

1. **Single Matchups Table**:
   - Initially, the application will have a flat `matchups` table to capture all necessary information: matchups as well as bets.
   - A matchup is the event itself. For example, NBA Team 1 vs Team 2.
   - A bet is specific outcome or condition that the user can wager on. For example, we can have two distinct bets based on the outcomes: Bet 1: Team 1 win by 5 points. Bet 2: Team 1 win by 20 points. Each bet will have odds, which is the likelihood of the winning, for example: Bet 1 might have odds of 2.0, and Bet 2 might have different odds, say 3.0.
2. **Future Changes**:
   - The application may introduce a `bets` table with a foreign key `matchupId` to the `matchups` table, allowing for normalization of data.

##### Normalization vs. Denormalization

###### Normalization

- **Pros**:
  - Reduced data redundancy.
  - Easier maintenance of consistency.
- **Cons**:
  - Increased complexity in querying.
  - Potential increased read costs.

###### Denormalization

- **Pros**:
  - Simplicity in querying.
  - Faster performance for read operations.
- **Cons**:
  - Data redundancy.
  - Risks of consistency issues.

#### Recommendation

- Adopt a denormalized structure in the initial stages to simplify querying.
- Implement processes for maintaining data consistency during updates.

#### SQL vs. NoSQL Considerations

##### Using DynamoDB

1. **Schema Flexibility**:
   - DynamoDB allows for rapid iterations without a predefined schema.
2. **Scaling**:
   - Designed for horizontal scaling, suitable for anticipated user growth.
3. **Complex Queries**:
   - Limited support for complex queries, which may pose challenges as the application evolves.
4. **Data Consistency**:
   - Offers eventual consistency, which may not be suitable for critical betting operations.

##### Conclusion

- **DynamoDB Suitability**:
  - Pros: Rapid development, high scalability for simple MVP.
  - Cons: Challenges in transitioning to a normalized structure and limited query capabilities.
- **Recommendation**:
  - If aiming for rapid MVP development without complex queries, DynamoDB is a suitable choice.
  - However, if complex relationships and queries are anticipated, considering a SQL database may be beneficial for long-term development.

#### Decision

To maintain simplicity and facilitate rapid development, the current matchups table will remain, enhanced by adding an array of bets. Each wager will detail options like:

- Wager description (e.g., "Home team under 4 points")
- Potential payout per 100 (e.g., "120" for a wager with a payout of 120:100)

This structure will allow for flexibility in managing betting options while keeping the data model straightforward.

##### Example Calculation

If a user inserts a stake of $1,000 for a wager with odds of 120:100, the potential payout would be calculated as follows:

- Winnings: ($1,000 Ã— 120) / 100 = $1,200
- Total Payout: $1,000 (stake) + $1,200 (winnings) = $2,200

#### Next Steps

Discuss these considerations with the client to evaluate the best approach for the betting application's database architecture.
